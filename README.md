## Instructions
There are two ways to access this website.

On localhost of your device
---------------------------
1. On your Google Chrome, install [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=th) extension since Google Chrome doesn't allow CORS when developing on localhost. So, we need to use this tool.
2. Click on the extension icon, then click `ON` to allow CORS
3. Clone this project
4. Go to the project directory by typing `cd nytimes-most-popular` in terminal
5. run the app by typing `npm run dev` then press `Enter` in the terminal

Access this site I hosted on Vercel
-----------------------------------
1. Here is the [Link to the website](https://bitkub-clone-a9acukhzh-sirapavee.vercel.app/)
2. If the CORS problem is presented, I suggest installing the [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=th) extension.
